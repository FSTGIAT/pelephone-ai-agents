More detailed explanation if necessary
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Update existing tests when modifying functionality
